            Remote Vehicle Assistance at Motional
          </h2>
          <p>
            In October 2023, I was promoted and switched teams to lead the
            design of Remote Vehicle Assistance (RVA) at Motional. The software
            we designed enabled remote operators to overcome challenging AV
            scenarios with dynamic tools, removing the need for human
            intervention from the driver's seat. Our main users were these
            remote operators, otherwise known as agents. The agents worked from
            duel monitor workstations located in the Command Center room of our
            Las Vegas office.

          <h3 class="text-center mb-3">The Team</h3>
          <p>
            The team dynamic on RVA was a bit intense when I first joined.
            Everyone was in a constant rush to meet harsh deadlines, but there
            were limited team members, which caused stress on everyone. The
            stress led to difficult and sometimes heated conversations, which
            resulted in more stress. We slowly added more team members and
            worked out a process that better suited the team. Our team worked in
            a rapid-paced, agile process where each project was broken down into
            small and manageable chunks, only focusing on phase 0 (P0) to start.
            For phase 0, we built the minimum viable product (MVP), the minimum
            features needed for the feature to be usable by our agents. This
            allowed us to turn projects around quickly, engineering to build
            them in a sprint, and research and design to run usability testing,
            finding improvements we need to make for the next phase.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          Once the team got used to the process and could distribute the
          workload, I worked on enhancing the relationships on the team. I
          promoted stronger collaboration, communication, and efficiency by
          organizing team-building exercises, encouraging open communication,
          and focusing on clear and concise language when conversing with team
          members. After the team adapted to more efficient communication
          styles, we were able to have calm conversations even when times felt
          stressful. In the end, we loved working together as a team and felt we
          were able to overcome any challenges we faced.

          <p>
            When I first transitioned to the RVA team, there wasn't much of an
            onboarding process for new team members. While coming up to speed
            and piecing information together, I created a new onboarding process
            document in Figma (shown below on the left) breaking down everything
            I used to understand the team. I then used this to bring my direct
            report up to speed only a month after I joined. This effort cut
            onboarding new team members' time in half and was also useful for
            other teams to gain insight into how our team functioned.

          <h3 class="text-center mb-3">Organization</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to improving the onboarding process, I also enhanced our
            team organization. I joined RVA four months after the previous and
            only designer had been laid off, and due to this, had no one to
            guide me through the Figma Files. Unfortunately, the files I
            inherited were bare bones, lacking any key dates, description, or
            useful information, making the files unusable. This was a turning
            point where I realized the importance of clear and extensive
            documentation.
            <br />
            <br />
            In turn, I made it my mission to create structured Figma templates
            (pictured below) that anyone could dive into and understand exactly
            what was intended at each step of the process. In the template, the
            first page gives an overview of project information and subsequent
            pages break down each step of our process. This template kept our
            design handoffs consistent as well, making it quicker and easier for
            engineering to digest each new feature. Key dates, points of
            contact, decisions made, open questions, risks and more are now well
            documented throughout all our project documents.
            <br />
            <br />
            Prior to my joining, there had been no design system or reusable
            components. I created a design system (shown on the right above) for
            the RVA team and built a set of complex components. The complex
            components allowed designers to produce screens and prototypes in
            half the time, and made changing instances easy with the flip of a
            toggle.
            <br />
            <br />
            By creating templates for our design process in Figma and a
            comprehensive design system, I streamlined our workflows and ensured
            clarity through detailed documentation. As our team grew, we were
            able to stay efficient, consistent and organized.

          <p>
            Since we had offices worldwide, our team spent the majority of our
            time together virtually. We were efficient at finding ways to work
            together using various remote tools and often prioritized
            asynchronous communication. This meant we employed strong skills at
            refining content and clearly explaining our needs and questions to
            other team members. We often collaborated in Google Docs, Miro
            boards, and Figma files, leaving comments, questions, and critiques.
            <br />
            <br />
            We collaborated across timezones with team members working out of
            Boston, LA, Singapore, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. The time difference
            ranged from 1-3 hours to 12 hours. A few times a year, we would
            visit Las Vegas, the center of all operations, for in-person
            research sessions, hands on learning, and to sync face to face.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our designers and researchers mostly worked out of the Boston
            office, so we would get together in person for team whiteboarding
            sessions. At one point, my direct report was located in LA while I
            remained in Boston. We used this 3 hour time difference to our
            benefit by collaborating asynchronously on features and gaining 3
            additional working hours per day for our shared projects.

          <h5>Feasibility Checks</h5>
          <p>
            One problem we continuously faced on RVA was running into
            feasibility issues. We would learn about the constraints after we
            handed off our designs. This would prolong the project, lead to
            design rework, and postpone engineering’s start on the effort. To
            solve this problem, I implemented feasibility checks at multiple
            steps of our process. After the product team synced on the
            requirements and brainstormed as a team, we would meet with
            engineering to ask our open questions and give them a rough idea of
            potential solutions. Engineering was able to inform us what was
            possible, or workarounds we could make. We also had a second
            feasibility check right after concept testing and before we
            finalized the designs. This reduced rework on the design side and
            gave engineering a sense of what to expect with the final handoff.
            We were also able to incorporate feedback and requests from
            engineering, making it a full team collaborative process. <br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Design Needs Checklist</h5>
          <p>
            Another issue we encountered when I first joined the team was a
            misunderstanding of project requirements and expectations from PM to
            research and design. The misunderstanding was due to requirements
            being written for both engineering and design. To solve this, I set
            up meetings with the product team members to read through the
            requirements together, gain a shared understanding, and specifically
            list out the expectations from design at each phase of the project.
            Design was then able to use this as a reference throughout the
            project and it aligned the team on future engagements.

                      We were hired by our client to unify the experience of their investor applications into a single platform.
                      Since user experience had not been a significant focus of their efforts, their technology platform had evolved into
                      a large set of overlapping applications that felt disjointed when brought together. In order to unify this experience, my team created
                      a set of 150+ icons that would serve as the face of each application within the platform.
